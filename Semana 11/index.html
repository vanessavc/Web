<h1> TSUNAMIS </h1>
       
<p>
Tsunamis can wreak havoc on coastal populations and landscapes. The December 26, 2004, tsunami in the Indian Ocean claimed some 150,000 lives and cleared the landscape on millions of acres of oceanfront terrain. Here are some measures you can take to avoid trouble if you're caught in a tsunami.
